\title{function to calculate UniFrac distance based on dissimilarity measure}
\usage{
iNEXTUniFrac(
  data,
  q = c(0, 1, 2),
  level = NULL,
  nboot = 10,
  conf = 0.95,
  PDtree = NULL,
  PDreftime = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{OTU data can be input as a \code{matrix/data.frame} (species by assemblages), or a \code{list} of \code{matrices/data.frames}, each matrix represents species-by-assemblages abundance matrix.\cr}

\item{q}{a numerical vector specifying the diversity orders. Default is c(0, 1, 2).}

\item{level}{A numerical vector specifying the particular value of sample coverage (between 0 and 1). \code{level = 1} means complete coverage (the corresponding UniFrac represents asymptotic UniFrac distance).\cr
If \code{level = NULL}, this function computes the gamma and alpha diversity estimates up to one (for \code{q>0}) or up to the coverage of double the reference sample size (for \code{q = 0});
the corresponding beta diversity and UniFrac distance is computed up to the same maximum coverage as the alpha diversity.}

\item{nboot}{a positive integer specifying the number of bootstrap replications when assessing sampling uncertainty and constructing confidence intervals. Bootstrap replications are generally time consuming. Enter \code{0} to skip the bootstrap procedures. Default is \code{10}.}

\item{conf}{a positive number < 1 specifying the level of confidence interval. Default is \code{0.95}.}

\item{PDtree}{a phylogenetic tree in Newick format for all observed species in the pooled assemblage.}

\item{PDreftime}{a numerical value specifying reference time for PD. Default is \code{NULL} (i.e., the age of the root of PDtree).}
}
\value{
a list of two data frames with two types dissimilarity measure for UniFrac distance.
